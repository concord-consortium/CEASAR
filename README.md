# CEASAR
Connections of Earth And Sky using AR/VR

Project uses Unity 2019.2.13f1 and is built using the Unity Cloud Build feature. AR features are currently in-development using the Unity AR Foundation toolkit, enabling builds for both Android and iOS with image targets. Previous experiments used the Vuforia library for this purpose, but due to license restrictions this is no longer used. 

## Network Components
This project relies on a central network server on Heroku for multiplayer functionality (currently early in development). The network server software is available [here](https://github.com/concord-consortium/CEASAR-server)
